    <p>First, we declare two constants: radius and pi. The radius constant is assigned the value 10, and pi is assigned the value of Math.PI which is a built-in constant in JavaScript that represents the value of pi (3.14159...).
    </p>
    <p>Next, we define a function named areaOfCircle that takes two parameters radius and pi.</p>
    <p>Inside the function, we use the formula for the area of a circle, which is pi * radius * radius, and return the result.</p>
    <p>Finally, we use console.log() to display the result of calling areaOfCircle with radius and pi as arguments. The result is a string that says "The area of the circle is: [area]".This program calculates the area of a circle with a radius of 10 and outputs the result to the console.</p>
    <script>
        const radius = 10;
        const pi = Math.PI;
        const areaOfCircle = (radius, pi) => {
            return pi * radius * radius;
        };
        console.log("The area of the circle is: " + areaOfCircle(radius, pi));
    </script>
