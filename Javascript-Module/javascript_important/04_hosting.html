// Declare Your Variables At the Top !
// Hoisting is (to many developers) an unknown or overlooked behavior of JavaScript.

// If a developer doesn't understand hoisting, programs may contain bugs (errors).

// To avoid bugs, always declare all variables at the beginning of every scope.

// Since this is how JavaScript interprets the code, it is always a good rule.


        var n = 2 // fisrt show in hosting varible alwyas in frist line

        function name(){
            document.write(n)
